## Visualizing DTFT - A tribute Porfessor Jia Xu

Porf. Xu died a year ago. He has made significant influence on my career and life. He was one of the very few teacher in the university
who encounrage students to understand and appreciate underlying beauty in science and engineering. I took his Digital Signal Processing 
course during my junior year, where I really started to find science and engineering fascinating. Before that, I just couldn't find any 
fun in all those tedious calculation in pretty much all other courses. 

My first ever attempt in througnly understanding scientific topic is trying to view Discrete Founrier Transform(DFT) in a form of matrix 
multiplication, where is easier to recognize the redundancy. I handed in the little note on this topic to Prof.Xu, and he encouraged me
a lot. Recently, I watched an extraodinary YouTube vedio on visualizing Fourier Transform by 3BLUE1BROWN. In order to play with it, I 
decide to build my own visualization, which is result in this repo.
